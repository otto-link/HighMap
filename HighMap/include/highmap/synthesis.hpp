 * @brief Provides functions for synthesizing new heightmaps from input arrays.
 *
 * This header file defines functions for synthesizing new heightmaps by
 * using various techniques such as non-parametric sampling, patch quilting,
 * and blending. These functions allow for the generation of larger or
 * modified heightmaps based on input data, using methods like patch stitching
 * and random sampling.
 *
 * Functions provided:
 * - `non_parametric_sampling`: Generates a new heightmap using non-parametric
 * sampling.
 * - `quilting`: Synthesizes a new heightmap by stitching patches from a set of
 * input heightmaps.
 * - `quilting_blend`: Similar to `quilting`, but includes blending of patches.
 * - `quilting_expand`: Synthesizes a larger heightmap by expanding and
 * stitching patches from an input heightmap.
 * - `quilting_shuffle`: Similar to `quilting_expand`, but reshuffles patches to
 * generate a new heightmap with the same shape.
