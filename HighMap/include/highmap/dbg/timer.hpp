/**
 * @brief The Timer class is a singleton that manages multiple Recorders and
 * provides an interface for timing events.
 *
 * The Timer class allows you to measure the duration of multiple events by
 * using start and stop commands. Each event is identified by a unique name. The
 * Timer class maintains a collection of these events and their corresponding
 * durations. The class is designed as a singleton, meaning only one instance of
 * Timer will exist throughout the lifetime of the program.
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 *
 * @code
 * #include "timer.hpp"
 *
 * int main() {
 *     // Start timing an event named "step 1"
 *     Timer::Start("step 1");
 *
 *     // Perform some work here...
 *
 *     // Stop timing the event named "step 1"
 *     Timer::Stop("step 1");
 *
 *     // Start and stop another event
 *     Timer::Start("step 2");
 *
 *     // Perform more work here...
 *
 *     Timer::Stop("step 2");
 *
 *     // Dump the timing results for all recorded events
 *     Timer::Dump();
 *
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
