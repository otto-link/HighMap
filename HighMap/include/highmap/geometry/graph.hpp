 * @brief Definition of the `Graph` class for manipulating 2D graphs.
 *
 * This file contains the definition of the `Graph` class, which extends from
 * the `Cloud` class to handle graph data structures in a 2D space. The `Graph`
 * class supports various functionalities such as graph visualization, edge
 * operations, graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Minimum Spanning
 * Tree), and exporting data to different formats (CSV, PNG).
 *
 * The class includes methods for computing distances, generating visual
 * representations, and manipulating graph edges and nodes. It also provides
 * functionalities for exporting the graph data to CSV and PNG formats, as well
 * as for calculating Signed Distance Functions (SDF) of the graph.
 *
 * @version 0.1 Initial version.
