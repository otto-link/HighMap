 * @brief Packs eight 2-bit values into a 16-bit integer.
 *
 * This macro takes eight 2-bit values (`a` through `h`) and packs them into a
 * single 16-bit integer. The bits are shifted into position according to their
 * specified offsets to form the final packed value.
 *
 * @param  a The first 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 15 bits).
 * @param  b The second 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 13 bits).
 * @param  c The third 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 11 bits).
 * @param  d The fourth 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 9 bits).
 * @param  e The fifth 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 7 bits).
 * @param  f The sixth 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 5 bits).
 * @param  g The seventh 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 3 bits).
 * @param  h The eighth 2-bit value (will be shifted left by 1 bit).
 *
 * @return   A 16-bit integer where the input values have been packed together
 *           according to their respective shifts.
 *
 * @note Each parameter (`a` through `h`) should only occupy 2 bits (values

 * @brief Identifies and labels connected components within a binary or labeled

 * Connected-component labeling is a technique used to identify clusters of

 * image processing and spatial analysis to isolate regions of interest, such as
 * detecting distinct objects or areas within a heightmap.
 *
 * **Usage**
 * - Use this function to label distinct features within an array, such as
 * individual water bodies, forest patches, or elevation features.
 * - Apply the surface threshold to filter out small, insignificant components
 * that might be noise or irrelevant.

 *                           to be retained. Components smaller than this
 *                           threshold will be removed. The default value is 0
 *                           (no filtering).
 * @param  background_value  The value used to represent background pixels,
 *                           which are not part of any component. Default is 0.
 * @return                   Array An array with labeled connected components,
