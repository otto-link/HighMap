This file contains the definition of the {\ttfamily Cloud} class, which is used to manage and manipulate unordered sets of points in a 2D space. The {\ttfamily Cloud} class provides functionalities for creating clouds of points, including random generation, value assignment, and data export. It also supports operations such as computing bounding boxes, distances, and interpolating values from arrays.

The class includes methods for adding and removing points, randomizing positions and values, remapping values, and exporting data to CSV files. Additional functionalities include calculating Signed Distance Functions (SDF) and projecting point clouds onto arrays.
