This file contains the definition of the {\ttfamily Graph} class, which extends from the {\ttfamily Cloud} class to handle graph data structures in a 2D space. The {\ttfamily Graph} class supports various functionalities such as graph visualization, edge operations, graph algorithms (e.\+g., Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree), and exporting data to different formats (CSV, PNG).

The class includes methods for computing distances, generating visual representations, and manipulating graph edges and nodes. It also provides functionalities for exporting the graph data to CSV and PNG formats, as well as for calculating Signed Distance Functions (SDF) of the graph.
