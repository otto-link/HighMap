## Getting started

### Getting the sources

Use `git` to retrieve the sources: 
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:otto-link/HighMap.git
cd HighMap
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

#### Linux

Build by making a build directory (i.e. `build/`), run `cmake` in that dir, and then use `make` to build the desired target.

Example:
``` bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Simple examples are provided for most of the functions, for instance:
```
bin/./ex_noise_fbm
eog ex_noise_fbm_*.png
```

#### Windows

Use `PowerShell` to clone the repository (because Visual Studio won't clone the submodules) using `git` command lines (see above).

Install the missing OpenSource dependencies using `vcpkg`:
```
vcpkg install libpng glm ocl-icd-opencl-dev assimp opencv
```

You should then be able to build the sources using Visual Studio.

### CMake Integration

To integrate HighMap into your CMake-based project, follow these steps:

1. Add the library to your project's `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(HighMap)
   target_link_libraries(your_project_target highmap)
   ```
2. Link the `highmap` library to your target, as shown above.
